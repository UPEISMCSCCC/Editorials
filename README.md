# Editorials

This repo contains descriptions of various problems that were solved. It's intended to get people up to speed on various techniques used, and allow them to apply these techniques elsewhere.

It's recommended that you attempt these problems before reading their editorial.

## Basic Problems

Problems that don't require very much knowledge about competitive programming, and are good starting problems.

1. [hello](./hello.md)
2. [quadrant](./quadrant.md)
3. [lastfactorialdigit](./lastfactorialdigit.md)
4. [dicecup](./dicecup.md)
5. [autori](./autori.md)
6. [beatspread](./beatspread.md)

## Advanced Problems 

Problems that either take a lot of creative work, or use techniques that you may not have seen outside of competitive programming.

1. [walrusweights](./walrusweights.md)
